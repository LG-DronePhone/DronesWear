#DronesWear

##Purpose
DronesWear is an Android app which lets you control some of the Parrot drones
with your Android wear device (and its handheld device).

##Supported Parrot drones
For the moment, you can control these drones:

- Bebop
- Bebop 2
- Jumping Sumo
- Jumping Race
- Jumping Night

##Interactions

###Flying drones
On the flying drones, you can take off and land, 
and also control the drone on pitch and roll 
(make them fly forward, backward, on left and right).
On the handheld device, you can at any time stop the propellers 
in case of emergency.

###Jumping drones
You can pilot the jumping drones with the watch. You can also make them jump.

##Security
At any time, you can stop piloting the drone with the *pilot from wear* switch button 
on your phone. Switching it off will make the flying drones hover 
and the jumping ones stop moving.

##Usage
1. Connect your phone to the drone's Wifi. <br/>
**If an Android notification asks you if you want to stay connected even 
if there is no internet connection, please answer yes**.
2. Open the app on your phone and on your watch (no precise order required).
3. Wait for the app to connect to your drone (a message will inform you about the status)
4. Now that you're connected, the action button is displayed on the watch.
5. Just move your wrist gently and see how the drone moves :)

##SDK
The app uses the latest SDK release. It gets the SDK libs from JCenter.
